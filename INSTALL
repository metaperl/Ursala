This package includes the compiler for the Ursala programming language
(bin/fun) and related libraries (lib/*.avm). In order for it to work,
it depends on the virtual machine emulator available from

https://github.com/gueststar/Avram

Please refer to the avram documentation for installation instructions.
Some optional external libraries usable by avram are recommended but
not required, notably the mpfr library for arbitrary precision
arithmetic.

Root installations
------------------

The compiler may be installed either system-wide or for an individual
user. For the former case, the system administrator (i.e., the
root user) should unpack the .tar archive (probably done already
if you're reading this) and copy the files as shown.

$ tar -zxf ursala-0.1.0.tar.gz
$ cp ursala-0.1.0/bin/* /usr/local/bin
$ mkdir /usr/local/lib/avm
$ chmod ugo+rx /usr/local/lib/avm
$ cp ursala-0.1.0/src/*.avm /usr/local/lib/avm
$ cp ursala-0.1.0/lib/*.avm /usr/local/lib/avm

Use of these standard directories is advantageous because it will
allow the virtual machine to locate the library files automatically
without requiring the user to specify their full paths.

Non-root installations
----------------------

If the compiler is installed only for an individual user, the
libraries and executables should be unpacked as above, but can be moved
to whatever directories the user prefers and can access. The virtual
machine will not automatically detect libraries in non-standard
directories, but on a GNU/Linux system it can be made to do so by way
of the AVMINPUTS environment variable. For example, if the
user wishes to store a collection of personal library modules under
$HOME/avm, the command

$ export AVMINPUTS=".:$HOME/avm"

either executed interactively or in a bash initialization script will
enable it. The syntax for equivalent commands may differ with other
shells.

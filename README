Welcome to Ursala, a very cool programming language. Thanks for giving
it a try. Installation instructions are in the file named INSTALL. An
extensive tutorial and reference is in doc/manual.pdf. See the web
page at http://www.basis.uklinux.net/ursala for additional notes and
news. Comments are welcome.

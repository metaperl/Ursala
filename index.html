        <p>This project is essentially an investigation of some off-beat ideas
about functional programming through the design and implementation of
a novel language called Ursala (a pseudo-acronym for universal
applicative language). Its main preoccupations are brevity and
flexibility for rapid prototyping, with a bias toward applications
involving text processing/compilation, trees, graphs, and number
crunching (via built-in API's for some good numerical libraries such
as lapack, gsl, mpfr, and others). It's probably best suited to
individual projects because it enforces no particular coding standards
or practices and makes unreadable code easier to write than most
non-esoteric languages.</p>

<p>Ursala is mainly an individual effort that has been around for some
years but neglected lately due to my day job. I'm now looking to
revive it and address some issues, such as improving the web presence
and on-line documentation. Watch this space for updates. Comments and
feedback are welcome on the mailing list, <a href="mailto:ursala-users@freelists.org">ursala-users@freelists.org</a>.</p>

Its main preoccupations are brevity and\r\nflexibility for rapid prototyping, with a bias toward applications\r\ninvolving text processing/compilation, trees, graphs, and number\r\ncrunching (via built-in API's for some good numerical libraries such\r\nas lapack, gsl, mpfr, and others). It's probably best suited to\r\nindividual projects because it enforces no particular coding standards\r\nor practices and makes unreadable code easier to write than most\r\nnon-esoteric languages.\r\n\r\nUrsala is mainly an individual effort that has been around for some\r\nyears but neglected lately due to my day job. I'm now looking to\r\nrevive it and address some issues, such as improving the web presence\r\nand on-line documentation. Watch this space for updates. Comments and\r\nfeedback are welcome on the mailing list, ursala-users@freelists.org.","google":""}
